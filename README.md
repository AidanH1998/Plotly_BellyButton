# Plotly_BellyButton

##Purpose##

The Purpose of this repository is to upload and organize data to a dashboard so that the users can pick and chooses what they want. In this example we have to show the belly button biodiversity on a dashboard. We learn how to create different graphs that tell us different data. 

In Deliverable 1, we look at the amount of different samples that the different subject have, and we put it in a horizontal bar graph to look at the top 10 samples.

In Deliverable 2, we looked at the bacteria and the subjects that have the bacteria. So if the ID of the subject is with in the range of amount the bubble gets bigger.

In Deliverable 3, we have a scale from 0-10 telling us the amount of time the subjects clean their belly button.

With all this information we have to organize it on the dashboard, so that we can catagorize the data, for users to read.


##Module 12##

In this Module we sort a JSON file by accessing it with d3.json so use the file in organizing the data through their classes.

We also look at three different graph that implement the data from the JSON file.
